Parametric Tests : Testing means and variances based on single and two samples using R.

1. The following is a random sample of 15 measurements of thickness of plastic sheet (in inches) used for making chairs.
5.64,7.48,8.99,6.44,8.95,6.48,7.96,4.96,5.98,2.99,8.63,8.24,7.36,4.05,7.77
Test whether the population mean of thickness of the plastic sheet is 6.45 inches.

2. The two following samples are drawn from two populations. Test the equality of varinaces of two populations.
Sample I : 66.5,95.2,88.8,23.5,59.3,43.3,20.5,83.2,29.3,83.6
Sample II : 60.5,12.1,78.8,29.2,45.7,76.4,91.5,36.7,69.5,4.7,15.1,89.5,49.1

3. Sample size n=25 and sample standard deviation=8.5. Test whether the sample is drawn from population whose standard deviation is 10.
